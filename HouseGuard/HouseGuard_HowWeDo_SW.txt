Once Raspberry's prepared, we need to install pygame and git packages.

1. pygame install
sudo apt-get install python-pygame

2. git install
sudo apt-get install git
sudo reboot

3. clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/futurecrafts/RaspberryPi.git
There are a few python scripts and wav files there, but we're going to use 'playsound_with_pir.py'.

4. Run python script
cd RaspberryPi/HouseGuard
sudo python playsound_with_pir.py
Now, our RaspberryPi is ready to detect any movement with PIR sensor! :-)
